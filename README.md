# TrustFlow – ETHGlobal Unite DeFi 2025 Project  

🚀 **This project was built from scratch during ETHGlobal Unite DeFi (July 29 – Aug 4, 2025).**  
All commits, code, and features were created specifically for this hackathon.

I made it Lovable, so there are a lot of big commitments. But this isn't even a boilerplate cord, it's only made during a complete hackathon.
